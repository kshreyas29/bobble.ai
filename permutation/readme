Since we will be taking command line arguments 
So for windows the following steps need to be followed:-
      1 enter the directory where the executable.py file and input.csv files are present
      2 now write the following command on the prompt "python executable.py input.csv"
For linux only difference will come in second step where we will have to 
  first write chmod +777 executable.py
  ./executable.py input.csv
  OR 
  we could simply write "python executable.py input.csv"
